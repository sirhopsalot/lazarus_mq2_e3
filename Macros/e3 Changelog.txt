v5.1 r9 Change log:
--------- Fixed:
	- When using Gimme to your mage for Mod Shards, characters will no longer will disconnect if they are in the middle of a cast. 
	***NOTE*** If you use /itemnotify <item> leftmouseup while casting, your toon will DC! Avoid this with customizations!
	- Gimme large shard delete feature now works with all versions of Mod Shards 
	- Self Mod Shard for Supply mage now works
	- Fix for /GoM on spells in the nuke section. This should work properly now.
	- Gimme will now recast on fizzles and uses BC tells instead of /tell for group members.
	- Gimme will use e3_Cast now instead of raw /cast function
--------- Changed:
	- Optimizations for BuildSpellArray. Originally BuildSpellArray was for one time builds for spell casts at initial startup and the results saved and thus speed wasn't an important consideration. 
		> However the new method castSimpleSpellArray uses BuildSpellArray and thus a passthrough was neeeded. Entire method was reworked and reorganized. Over 140+ conditionals/checks/method calls removed in most circumstances.
	- /ClickIt will now dismount and call /stopcast before *IF* you are in the middle of a spell cast before clicking. This helps prevent crashes related to casting-while-initiating a zone
	- /SwarmPets changes:
		> Swarm Pets now trigger significantly quicker than before
		> Necromancer AA 'Rise of Bones' is correctly added to the swarpPets array when you own the AA
		> Necromancer Epic 1.5 / 2.0 are both now included as a swarm pet
		> Graverobber's Icon from HCUR is now included as a swarm pet
		> Necromancer "Wake the Dead" has been REMOVED from /SwarmPets because it is known to cause zone crashes. You can still include it in other parts of your INI like Burns at your own risk.
	- Old #inst add code has been completely removed.
--------- Added:
	- New Magician feature for gearing group pets automatically (details below)
	- A timer on nukes was created to prevent an item from being 'attempted' to be cast mutiple times even if it was on cooldown. 
		> E3 would cast the item, then loop back around and it would see the item as a valid cast again as "cooldown" would not be set yet. 
		> Now a 1 second timer is created for any item based nuke to give time for the client to get the updated value and start the items cooldown.  
		> This probably should be done in other areas but at the time I was testing Molten Orb from the mage.
	- Players can now send the expedition leader a tell saying "dzadd" to automatically get invites. 
	***EXAMPLE*** "/t Ewiclip dzadd" (single player) or "/bcaa //t Ewiclip dzadd" (all eqbcs players)
	- Necromancer "Orb of Shadows" and "Orb of Souls" will now automatically cast on Tank Heals and XTarget Heal if the target is below 90% HP immediately following a heal. This can be toggled on/off inside the Heal Section of the INI. This feature is ON by default. 
	***NOTE*** E3 WILL NOT BEEP IF YOU'RE OUT OF ORBS. It is completely up to you to ensure your healers have orbs in their inventory if you'd like to use this feature. 
	- castSimpleSpell "spellName" "targetid"
	> This will use e3 Cast but is far simpler to use. Used for spells that are non combat related and you don't expect to fail
		Stop using /casting please :)
	- notifyViaBCTell  ${ChatSender} "Message"
		> this will try and use /bct if the ChatSender is in your group of bots, else it uses /tell
	- check_Basics
		>This is added for a check method you want to work across all toons, to limit the pollution of the Adv.ini 

	- PrivateCode.inc created and included for everyone. This is a place to include your personal customizations that you don't want to lose with future updates. 
	***We will not provide future updates to this file. **NOTE** be sure to not overwrite your file with a future "BLANK" file***
	***if you contribute to the github repository you can use this command to prevent git from uploading your private code ***
	*** 	> git update-index --skip-worktree e3_PrivateCode.inc ****
	
--------- Pet Arming Changes:
	- New Arm Pets feature which opens up new commands to the mage in your group.
		> From the non-mage send a /tell to your mage
		-> "arm pets", 
		-> "arm pets fire" , 
		-> "arm pets ice", 
		-> "arm pets 2dispel", 
		-> "arm pets default <character>", 
		-> "arm pets ice <character>", 
		-> "arm pets fire <character>" 
		-> "arm pets 2dispel <character>"
	
	This will equip all the members of your group (if you don't specify character) with the spectral plate/heirlooms + configured loadouts for your class.
	***NOTE*** a free bag space is required from your mage. 

	- If you have any particular loadouts that you want to see, please let me know so I can include them. 
		> Currently:
		-> Mage/Enc/Nec default is Slow/Dispell.  SK/Druid default is Dispell/Mala, Everyone else is also Dispell/Mala. 
		-> Mage/Enc/Nec fire is Fire/Fire, Sk/Druid is Fire/Mala
		-> Mage/Enc/Nec ice is ice/ice, SK/Druid is ice/mala.
		-> Mage/Enc/Nec 2dispel is dispel/dispel, SK/Druid is dispel/dispel.

	- Damage Over Time spells now read the Target data instead of timer data for recasting.
	- "QuickCast" feature added to allow items/AAs to cast immediately after spells without pausing for the universal cooldown. INIs need to define an item/AA immediately after a spell to take advantage of this.

	- Reworked Nukes to cast the entire array rather then the first available cast.
	- Tweaked Combat Abilities so they will work whenever you're in combat.  Previously they were tied to /assiston, so your warrior wouldnt taunt or kick until after the mob was below 98%

--------- Added:

===============================================================================================================================================================================================

v5.1 r5 Change log:

--------- Fixed:

	- Fixed an issue that was causing bots to assist after being rezzed.
	- Heal Chain using incorrect spell names.  There was a issue with some users having "Complete Heal" while others were using "Complete Healing".  The macro should now chose the appropriate spell.
	- Rogue Auto-Hide
	- Minor tweak to consent me function
	- An issue that would cause all bots to stick behind on an assist call, regardless of the position listed in the ini.
	- Fixed a minor issue with Auto-Evade that was causing hide to be engaged before a rogue's sneak attack discipline could be activated.  Sneak attack disciplines should activate as soon as both the disc, and hide, are available.
	- Fixed an issue with BotBuffs, that was causing a mistarget.

--------- Changed:
	
	- Users can now request buffs from and add aliases for items as well as spells.
	- Added a retry timer to click yes and click no functions.
	- Revamped the group up function to fix issues caused with the way groups were being saved.

--------- Added:

	- Added debug toggles for individual macro .incs to give users the option to debug smaller portions of the macro.
	- Added /fixcorpses function.  New function that hides then shows all corpses, in an attempt to reset incorrect corpse locations.  (when you see a corpse one place but it's actually somewhere else.)
	- Gather corpse function.  Use /gathercorpses to pull all consented corpses within range to you.
	- AE Rez function.  Use /AERez to rez all nearby corpses.
	- Auto-Tribute.
		Auto-Tribute is a new function that attempts to conserve tribute points by giving users options to dynamically activate and deactivate tribute.
		Users can use /tribute "on/off" to toggle tribute on or off for all bots.  Tribute will automcatically be deactivated when you zone, or have been standing idle for 10 minutes or more.
		Alternatively users can add a timer setting to toggle tribute for a given amount of time.  Ex /tribute On|30m, or /tribute Off|15m.
		Finally, users can also designate 'tribute zones' by using the command /tributezone "On/Off".  Tribute will automatically be toggled on, and stay on, whenever you enter a designated 'tribute zone'.

===============================================================================================================================================================================================

v5.1 r4 Change log:

--------- Fixed:

	- Fixed an issue that caused attack to turn back on after enrage.

--------- Changed:

	- Bots will no longer Auto-Assist on spells.  I had set up the Auto-Assist to detect the casting of detrimental spells, but I really don't think I like the changes.
		Bots will now only Auto-Assist based on a melee engage.  Otherwise, they must be sent in manually using /assiston.

===============================================================================================================================================================================================
===============================================================================================================================================================================================

v5.1 r3 Change log:

	- a non numeric encounter in BegForBuffs.inc that caused crashes when you were sent a tell containing an integer.

===============================================================================================================================================================================================
===============================================================================================================================================================================================

v5.1 r2 Change log:

--------- Fixed:

	- Fixed an issue with casting bot buffs that had a range of 0.  Fixed by adding AERange to the check.

	- Fixed a typo in HoT that was causing it not to work
	- Fixed an issue with warrior provoke disciplines being used as default discs
	- Fixed issues with /CheckFor| in the [Buffs] section of the Bot.inis.  Spells like Elemental Siphon should work properly now

--------- Changed:

	- Revamped v5.0s clumsy, over-complicated settings files.
		In an effort to try and make e3's settings files more user friendly, I've reorganized File Paths.ini, e3 Settings.ini, and Functions By Class.ini into
		two new settings files; General Settings.ini, and Advanced Settings.ini.  The new files will give the user a more comprehensive view of all the various
		macro settings, and how they tie together.  I've also begun adding additional settings that will allow users to customize e3 more than ever.

--------- Added:
	
	- Added enchanter chain rune.  Use /runeOn /runeOff, or /runeOn NAME, /runeOff NAME to enable enchanter chain runes.  (You must have a Chain Rune spell defined in your enchanters ini)
